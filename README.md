# NLP Project - May 28th, 2019

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook related to a project for a course called 'Natural Language Processing', taught at the University of Maastricht.

The project tackles a simple sentiment analysis of a data set consisting of song lyrics, which has been extracted from https://www.kaggle.com/gyani95/380000-lyrics-from-metrolyrics.

In the current society, music has become integral to an individual - regardless of what genre, people want to express themselves through music. It can be related to on an emotional level, i.e. they find sentiments in music they think defines the personal environment of a person.

Countless of songs have been made in modern times - with each their own set of lyrics, which have their own meaning and sentiment involved. While a human being can draw a certain emotion from said song texts, it would be of great interest to have it automated.
